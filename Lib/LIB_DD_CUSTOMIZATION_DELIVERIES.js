		/**
		 * @documented
		 * If defined, it overrides the default grouping key for email grouping.
		 *
		 * All fields that can be used into the list are fields from the "Customer Invoice (customer copy)" form.
		 * Note that you can't use external variables values to group, only form fields can be set.
		 *
		 * If the user exit is not defined, the default grouping key will be ["Customer_ID__", "Customer_email__"].
		 * The value "Customer_delivery_method__" is implicit: it will be automatically added by the processing into
		 * the list because we won't group email portal notification with emails with attachments.
		 * Technically, the field list is used in the query first, then used to determinate when a new mail has to been sent.
		 *
		 * A common case of custom grouping is using a custom field like "Additional_field_text_1__" (see first example below).
		 *
		 * Be aware of problems that can happen if you remove the "Customer_ID__" from the list, for instance if you
		 * want to group with ["Customer_email__"] only (see second example). It will result into a single email at destination
		 * of several customers with different portals. The first customer read during grouping will be used to determinate top
		 * and bottom links, customer company name, the email language and culture for numbers.
		 * Note that every table links will point the correct portal BUT if the customer is already logged in a portal, clicking
		 * and an other link will be really confusing because the customer will stay on the already connected portal.
		 *
		 * The parameter deliveryMethod will be set with SM for emails with attachments or PORTAL for portal notification.
		 * It allows you to condition in order to have different grouping key foreach delivery method.
		 *
		 * @example
		 * <pre><code>
		 *	CustomizeEmailGroupingKey: function(deliveryMethod)
		 *	{
		 *		// We added "Additional_field_text_1__" in the grouping key so that a same customer receive one
		 *		// email grouped by value of this additional field. We can imagine that this field contains a
		 *		// value different for each company or business unit of the same customer.
		 *		// We keep the "Customer_email__" into the key because it might be extracted from the invoice,
		 *		// so a same customer ID could receive several emails.
		 *		return ["Customer_ID__", "Customer_email__", "Additional_field_text_1__"];
		 *	}
		 * </code></pre>
		 * @example
		 * <pre><code>
		 *	CustomizeEmailGroupingKey: function(deliveryMethod)
		 *	{
		 *		// In this scenario, several customer contacts have the same email address so we want to group
		 *		// all notification into one single email. Be really careful, it brings some problems that are
		 *		// explained above in the user exit description.
		 *		return ["Customer_email__"];
		 *	}
		 * </code></pre>
		 * @example
		 * <pre><code>
		 *	CustomizeEmailGroupingKey: function(deliveryMethod)
		 *	{
		 *		// In this example we want to define different grouping key for portal notification and email
		 *		// with attachment. For portal notification we want to group like usually, but for the email
		 *		// we want to split by a business field.
		 *		if( deliveryMethod == "SM" )
		 *		{
		 *			// Group emails with attachments by customer and business field
		 *			return ["Customer_ID__", "Customer_email__", "Additional_field_text_1__"];
		 *		}
		 *		else
		 *		{
		 *			// Group portal notifications by customer
		 *			return ["Customer_ID__", "Customer_email__"];
		 *		}
		 *	}
		 * </code></pre>
